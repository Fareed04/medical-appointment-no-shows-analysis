### 📌 Project Overview
Why do patients miss their scheduled appointments? This project analyzes over **110,000 medical records** from Brazil to identify the variables that influence "No-shows." We transition from descriptive analytics to **Binary Classification** to predict whether a patient will show up.

### 📊 Key Research Questions
1. Does the **waiting time** between booking and the appointment increase no-shows?
2. Are patients with **Scholarships** (government assistance) more likely to miss appointments?
3. How effective are **SMS reminders** in reducing absenteeism?
4. Can we predict a "No-Show" with at least **70% accuracy**?

### 🛠️ The ML Workflow
1. **Data Wrangling:** Handling negative age values and converting timestamps.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating a `Waiting_Days` column from dates.
3. **EDA:** Visualizing correlations between health conditions (Diabetes, Alcoholism) and attendance.
4. **Modeling:** Implementing **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing performance via **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC-AUC scores**.
